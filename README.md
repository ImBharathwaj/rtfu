### When I was trying to stop my hairfall & dandruff issue, I couldn't find right shampoo for me.
### I tried various shampoo in plenty of shampoo brand, Finally I ended up bald still I couldn't find the right product.
### If this is an issue how can I find the right product for my problem. So, I started to thinking about this issue. Then I came up with an idea of developing this application to find the right product for the right consumer by referring consumers review & recommendation.
### Cuz, Influencer may lie about product that they advertise or market. But, The consumer never does.
